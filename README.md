# OpenSpace3D-Apps

Two Open Space 3D Apps developed for my Edrivetour Intermediate Project. They are meant to be opened with OpenSpace3D and they were developed so someone
could scan a qr code and then see the 3d models of the battery and engine of a Toyota Yaris Hybrid while also seeing some relevant datasheets for both.
This is currently a work in progress with future plans being merging the two applications into one and by clicking buttons showing the relevant information
like the engine's or battery's datasheet, 3D model etc.
